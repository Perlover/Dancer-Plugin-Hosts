NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Hosts - Config trigger for virtual sites

SYNOPSIS
    This plugin doesn't have syntax commands. It has only configurable
    options in Dancer config file. It changes appdir & application settings
    by seeing in "Host:" HTTP header. For every site you can use different
    directories and application settings in one Dancer process (author
    tested from Starman + Dancer bundle). Also you can use your own signle
    'App' module for some sites. Additional you can set any your own
    settings as Dancer::setting command does.

        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Hosts;

        get '/' => sub {
            template 'foo';
        };

        dance;

CONFIGURATION
  Example
        plugins:
            Hosts:
                http://app1.foo.com:
                    alias: http://www.app1.foo.com
                    appdir: /foo-2/dir
                    application: My::App1

                http://app1.foo2.com:
                    alias: http://www.app1.foo2.com
                    appdir: /foo-2/dir
                    public: /where/public/dir

                    # 'confdir' will be as "$appdir" setting
                    # 'views' will be as "$appdir/veiws"
                    # 'public' will be as "/where/public/dir"

                    # Here we use same module of application as in previous example
                    application: My::App1

                http://app2.foo.com:
                    alias: http://www.app2.foo.com
                    appdir: /foo-3/dir

                    # Here no 'application'
                    # so will be used 'main' App of Dancer

                # Here site is located at 81th port
                http://app3.foo.com:81:
                    appdir: /foo-4/dir
                    application: My::App3

PLUGIN OPTIONS
  appdir
    *This option is required*. If you have only one "appdir" setting for
    directory settings of one host site then other directory settings will
    be set to following values (as Dancer does itself):

        confdir     -> appdir
        public      -> appdir/public
        views       -> appdir/views

  application
    *This option is optional*. If you will define it then the module after
    it will be loaded if need through Dancer::load_app command and all
    settings for this host will be set for this App settings. Otherwise
    application will be 'main' (Dancer no App default)
